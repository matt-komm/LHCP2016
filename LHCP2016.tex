\section{Introduction}
Measurements of single top quark production are an unique test of electroweak interactions~(EWK) involving heavy quarks. Cross section measurements of the three production modes, $t$~channel, tW~channel, and $s$~channel, offer a model-independent probe of the CKM matrix element $\mathrm{V}_\mathrm{tb}$. Furthermore, the fact that the top quark does not hadronize before its decay allows to analyse the parity-violating EWK coupling structure. In addition, one can use events containing single top quarks to probed for alternative production mechanisms as predicted in various new beyond the standard model physics~(BSM).

In this note, recent measurements of single top quark production and properties by the CMS collaboration are reviewed.


\section{Cross section measurements of $t$-channel single-top-quark production at 13~TeV}

The inclusive~(Ref.~\cite{CMS-PAS-TOP-16-003}) and differential~(Ref.~\cite{CMS-PAS-TOP-16-004}) single-top-quark cross section in $t$-channel is measured using the first pp collision data corresponding to $2.3~\mathrm{fb^{-1}}$ at a centre-of-mass energy of 13~TeV recorded in 2015. Events containing a well isolated muon with a transverse momentum of $\pt>22~\mathrm{GeV}$ and 2 or 3 jets with $\pt>40~\mathrm{GeV}$ are selected. Furthermore, multijet events are suppresed by requiring a transverse W~boson mass of $\mtw>50~\mathrm{GeV}$. A neutral network~(NN) is trained to separate the signal from the \wjets and \ttbar backgrounds. The inclusive cross section is estimated using a simultaneous binned maximum-likelihood~(ML) fit to the distribution of its discriminant~(Fig.~\ref{fig:TOP-16-003-2j1t-NN}) in signal~(2~jets, 1~b-tag) and control regions~(3~jets, 1~or 2~b-tags). The inclusive cross section is measured as $\sigma=227.8^{+33.7}_{-33.0}~\mathrm{pb}$ which agrees well with the next-to-leading order prediction of $\sigma_{t\mbox{-}\mathrm{ch.}}^\mathrm{theo.}=217.0^{+9.0}_{-7.7}~\mathrm{pb}$ using \textsc{HATHOR}v2.1~\cite{hathor}. Additionally, the charge ratio is measured through separate fits to the NN distributions from top quark and antiquark events. The measured ratio is compared to the predictions by various PDF sets in Fig.~\ref{fig:TOP-16-003-2j1t-R}.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

The normalized differential cross section as a function of the top quark transverse momentum and rapidity is measured as well. For this, multiple fits are performed to the distributions of \mtw and a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) discriminant. Each fit is restricted to events within an interval of the momentum or rapidity. The estimated signal yields are unfolded to parton level and compared to the predictions by various generators (Fig.~\ref{fig:TOP-16-004-unfolded}). No significant deviation is observed.

\section{Search for $s$-channel single-top-quark production at 7~and 8~TeV}
At the LHC, the smallest cross section for single-top-quark production is via the $s$-channel. It is predicted to be $\sigma_{s\mbox{-}\mathrm{ch.}}^\mathrm{7~TeV}=4.6\pm0.2$ and $\sigma_{s\mbox{-}\mathrm{ch.}}^\mathrm{8~TeV}=5.6\pm0.2$ at NLO+NNLL respectively~\cite{schannel-xsec}. A new search for this production mode has been performed recently~\cite{CMS-PAS-TOP-13-009} using the combined 7~and 8~TeV datasets corresponding to $5.1~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ and $19.7~\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ respectively.

Events with an isolated muon or electron with various $\pt$ thresholds ranging from $20~\mathrm{GeV}$ to $30~\mathrm{GeV}$ that follow the trigger requirements and 2 jets with $\pt>40~\mathrm{GeV}$ are selected. Multiple BDTs are trained per lepton type and centre-of-mass energy to disciminate against the overwhelming $\ttbar$ background. Figure~\ref{fig:schannel-BDT} shows the obtained distribution of the discriminats for muon events.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

The individual cross sections are estimated through ML fits as $\sigma^\mathrm{7~teV}_{s\mbox{-}\mathrm{ch.}}=7.1\pm8.1~\mathrm{pb}$ and $\sigma^\mathrm{8~teV}_{s\mbox{-}\mathrm{ch.}}=13.4\pm7.3~\mathrm{pb}$. A combined fit of the signal strength $\beta=\sigma^\mathrm{meas.}_{s\mbox{-}\mathrm{ch.}}/\sigma^\mathrm{theo.}_{s\mbox{-}\mathrm{ch.}}$ for 7~and 8~TeV yields $\beta=2.0\pm0.9$ corresponding to an observed significance of $2.5\sigma$.
